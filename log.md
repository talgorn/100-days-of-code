Day 0: January 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Created and updated Git repo,  added a project Overview to the README.MD, tried for an hour to make Camera functions properly. I either had a blank screen when working with Android docs, or a halt at launch time with an example project. So far , so almost_good :)
**Thoughts:** Not the first time Android Dev docs provide biased infos.
